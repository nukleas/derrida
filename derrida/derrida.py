# Derrida
#
# A deconstructionist program.
#
# By Nader Heidari
#
#
# The purpose of this program is to act as a sort
# of "build system" for text articles. A majority
# of text in an article is not programmatically
# relevant, so what we want to do is extract stuff
# such as URLs, company names, DOIs, whatever, and
# present them in a clean form.
#
# I chose the name derrida since the program ought
# to deconstruct the articles with a touch of context,
# provided by the programmer/reader.
#
# Pretentious? Sure, but let's get to the code.
